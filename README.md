# ggb expr rewriter to Nim

## Why It's Born
I once used [GeoGebra](GeoGebra.org) a lot.
While such a great software is it,
what annoys me very much is `GGBscript` written inside cannot have any word-wrap or
breaking code into multiply lines instead of keeping writing some closing `)))))` within a single line!

That's dawn sometimes!

So I wanna have a rewriter that at last allow me to break code in parentheses into several lines.

Despite all above, this project is far away a rewriter to GGBscript;

as it's quite a long time I've not used GGB, what I wanna do now is just make some amazing toys.

So this's a rewriter to Nim!
